      #### I first cloned Open3D by:

      ```

      git clone https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git

      cd Open3D

      ```


      #### Then, I build Open3D (on Ubuntu 20.04, with CUDA 11.5) with:

      ```

      mkdir build

      cd build

      cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=OFF -DUSE_BLAS=ON -DBUILD_WEBRTC=OFF ..

      make -j$(nproc)

      ```
